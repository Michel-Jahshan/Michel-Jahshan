# 👨‍💻My Interests
Even though I haven't had much experience in programming, I cannot wait to start coding professionally, especially when it comes to back-end development. I am somewhat proficient in C++ and C# and can put together a nice-looking app using Windows Forms, although I am thinking of diving into the cross-platform GUI world.
